Report for Sudoku Game Project 

For this programming assignment, I've decided to develop a Sudoku web 
application. The game can generate medium difficulty Sudoku puzzles 
and has the option to see the solution for each puzzle. 

I started off with thinking about how to represent the Sudoku Board. 
Because Nested Lists of Chars (Board data structure) seemed like a data structure I could work with,
I decided to use it to represent the 9x9 board. As can be reflected from the 
Sudoku.elm file, I've spent a good amount of time figuring out and designing
the inner mechanics of the Sudoku Board, as well as the helper functions 
necessary to examine and modify the board. 

The most challenging aspect of developing the app was figuring out how to
make the connection between the UI elements and the back-end data structure. 
Although working with HTML/CSS in order to find the fitting elements was 
time-consuming, I managed to develop a grid appropriate for the game 
and the helper functions for updating the Board data structure. Each cell 
is made up of 9 small "buttons", from which a player can make their choice
by pressing on one of them. To keep track of the player's choices, I've 
attached onClick function for each of the buttons so that it has the capacity
to update the main Board data structure. 

Furthermore, to generate game puzzles, it was necessary to make use of elm's 
Random library. Although initially it was confusing to deal with, I managed to 
create a simple puzzle generating algorithm using the library. The game 
generates a filled board before randomly removing ~60 cells to create a puzzle.

Compared to the past assignments, the project really challenged me to learn more 
about Random functions and UI components, as well as led me to figure out smarter ways of 
manipulating Msgs and Cmds in a web app in order to find a solution that fits
the complex structure of the Sudoku game.
